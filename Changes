0.03. (2008-06-29) - Adam Prime <adam.prime@utoronto.ca>

	- changed the debug interface to use the ::set_debug function rather than 
	  the package variable.  recommended usage would be in your subclasses init
	  function
	- added more documentation
	- renamed the index method to root_index, because index is also the name of a 
	  perl builtin.
