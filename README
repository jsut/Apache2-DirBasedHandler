DESCRIPTION
    This module is designed to allow people to more quickly implement uri to
    function style handlers

  handler
    the uri is cut up into bits, then the first argument is used to
    determine what page the user is after, so a function is called based on
    that argument. The rest of the uri, the request object, and all our
    template crap are then passed into that function. If there is no uri, a
    base function called index_page is called (which you really want to
    subclass)

  init
    The init function is used to stuff other things into the page function
    calls. it should probably return a hash reference to be the most useful.

  parse_uri
    takes an Apache::RequestRec (or derived) object, and returns a reference
    to an array of all the non-slash parts of the uri. It strips repeated
    slashes in the same manner that they would be stripped if you do a
    request for static content

  index
    index is the function called when someone requests the absolute root of
    the location you are talking about
